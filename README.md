# Three-Digit-Number-Sum-Calculator
The Three-Digit Number Sum Calculator is a simple Python program that takes a three-digit number as input from the user and calculates the sum of its individual digits.

## How it works:

- The input() function prompts the user to enter a 3 digit number.
- The individual digits are extracted using string indexing ([0], [1], [2]).
- The int() function converts the string digits to integers.
- The sum of the 3 digits is calculated and printed.
